# Spine Segmentation in 3D Slicer
## Final Project for CISC 472, Medical Informatics
### By Hannah Greer and Hillary Elrick

From Wikipedia:
"Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into different segments. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. In medical imaging, these segments often correspond to different tissue classes, organs, pathologies, or other biologically relevant structures. Medical image segmentation is made difficult by low contrast, noise, and other imaging ambiguities."

Medical Segmentation can be done manually by someone trained to recognized the features of interest, automatically by an algorithm, or semi-automatically. Methods for automatic segmentation include:
- Region Based Methods
  - Thresholding
  - Region Growing
- Classification Methods
  - k-Nearest Neighbours
  - Maximum Likelihood 
- Clustering Mehods
  - k-Means
  - Fuzzy C-Mean
  - Expectation Maximization
and Hybrid Methods
